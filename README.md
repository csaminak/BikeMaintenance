# Bike Memo

A web application that notifies a cyclist when it is time to get their bike tuned up.

We use an app called Strava, which tracks and logs all user biking and running activity. A cyclist will login into the site using Strava and then input information about their bike and it's individual parts.

By pulling the mileage from Strava, we can calculate when a part has reached its limit. At which point, our user will get an email notification to get their bike checked out.
