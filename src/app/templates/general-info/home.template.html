    <h2 class='viewTitle'>What do we do?</h2>

    <p>
        We let cyclists know when it is time to get their bike tuned up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the mileage calculated from your rides that are tracked
        through Strava, we are able to notify when it is time to get a part
        checked out.
    </p>
    <p>
        This liberates you from having to remember when to take your
        bike to the shop to get tuned up again.
